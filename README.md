## Task details
Prey-predator model #5 \
Target #1 \
Type - discrete \
Comments - i = 1
## Solution
### main_discrete.m
***Description:*** the script makes a numerical search of the coefficients on a certain segment (from 0.1 to 10 with step = 0.1) and selects those at which the system is sustainable, if there are no such coefficients it outputs a message that the system is unsustainable. \
***Input arguments:*** initial value of the prey and predator population and target of the prey population. \
***Output arguments:*** coefficients alpha2, beta2 when the system is sustainable or if there are no such coefficients a message that the system is unsustainable and also plots
## Additional
### solver.m
***Description:*** the script makes a plot of the system by a given target. \
***Input arguments:*** prey population target. \
***Output arguments:*** system plot.
